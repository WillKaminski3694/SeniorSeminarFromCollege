Hey there, thanks for downloading my Medieval Themes music pack!

You will find 10 loopable tracks (WAV files) with actual medieval instruments from the era,
such as the lute, the recorder, the hurdy-gurdy and the tromba marina.

I hope these tracks blend well into your game, whether you're making an RPG, a narrative game, or even a renaissance dating sim. 

Feel free to use this music for your commercial game, you don't need a license. 
It would be fantastic if you would credit me and send me your game so I can play it!

*********************************************************************

Would you like to work together for your game's soundtrack?
Do you need music that adapts real-time to your game's mechanics? I work with Audiokinetic's Wwise (used by Blizzard, 
CD Projekt Red and many AAA studios) to implement the music so you can test-drive it in Unity or other platforms.
